Description: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is designed to 
        estimate individual pharmacokinetic parameters with one 
        or more drug serum/plasma concentrations obtained from 
        a single subject or multiple subjects using a Bayesian
        inference porgram, JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampling; 
        a computer program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical
        models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation),
        interfaced with rjags. Besides, it also can calculate 
        a suggested dose based on the target drug concentration
        (C ->D) or calculate a predicted drug concentration 
        with a given dose (D -> C).
