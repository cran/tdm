v3.0.0 (official release)
-------------------------

    - warfarin model is still not working yet.
    - started to change codes from BUGS to JAGS; and added packages
      "rjags", "R2jags", etc..
    - remove the function of multiple subjects with single data point.
    - saved posterior estimate as .csv format and read it back to
      the system for dosage prediction; it used to be using
      'sampleStats("P") to call posterior estimates in previous
      version which takes a lot of time and computer resources
      to get such a value.
    - added Cys with target C2 levels;
    - fixed enoxaparin dosing adjustment with 'mg' now; originally
      was 'IU' which is not common to used in this way.
    - fixed multiple concs. listing with obs. vs. calc.
