tdm: Update log

v3.0.3
-------------------------
 - fixed package title as suggested;
 - fixed run();
 - modified the content of DESCRIPTION;
 
v3.0.2
-------------------------
 - added 11 opioids tdm; type 'oscar()' to run;
 - fixed Tmax equation in some modules;
 - fixed some *.rd files;
 - added simulation plots for opioids tdm in opioids tdm;
 - improved appropriate dosage regimen selection in opioids tdm;
 - adjusted the position of displayed texts in plots in opioids tdm;
 - switched from lsoda(...) to lsode(...) in opioids tdm for solving
   differential equations;
 - improved cl_F estimation with changing prior probability for cl_F 
   of its JAGS model in opioids tdm;
 - fixed simulation plots for multiple-dose with lsoda(..., events=...);

v3.0.1
-------------------------
 - fixed some tdm's input; used to be disabled for testing purpose;
 - tested with JAGS v3.4.0 vs. JAGS v3.3.0 under Windows 7; found 
   JAGS v3.4.0 may cause some models crashed; suggest to use JAGS 
   v3.3.0 for stable concern; seems OK for linux or Mac OS X.
 - fixed dose adjustment output formats;
 - fixed NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION two files for imported
   packages.

v3.0.0
-------------------------
 - warfarin model is still not working yet.
 - started to change codes from BUGS to JAGS; and added packages
   "rjags", "R2jags", etc..
 - remove the function of multiple subjects with single data point.
 - saved posterior estimate as .csv format and read it back to
   the system for dosage prediction; it used to be using
   'sampleStats("P") to call posterior estimates in previous
   version which takes a lot of time and computer resources
   to get such a value.
 - added Cys with target C2 levels;
 - fixed enoxaparin dosing adjustment with 'mg' now; originally
   was 'IU' which is not common to used in this way.
 - fixed multiple concs. listing with obs. vs. calc.
